## Overview

I want to create an app that shows me the lattitude and longitude of my entered search query. As well as weather and event information.
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. 
(i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
The client will need the ability to download the dependencies and the personal API keys.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
We are using JavaScript to write the backend code for the server. This app uses the geo.json and darksky.json libraries.

## Change Log
